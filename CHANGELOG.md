### Trial of the Grand Crusader
CLM is now ready for ToGC. Trophy and Regalia will now be classified as `Non-equippable` for default and dynamic item value classification. Their ilvl is now adjusted internally (245/258). ToGC bosses have now their respective encounter ids mapped since old ones are used same as for Ulduar.
### Auction and Bidding UI slight refresh
With trophies and regalia fitting  5 slots, up to 5 upgraded items will now be displayed when bidding on item. This required slight UI rework and resulted in `Pass` being moved and `Next` button added (to skip bidding on the current item without sending information to auctioneer).
## Fix

Same as for Classic - cross-guild sync is not supported however cross-guild bidding should be possible.

## Fixes

# Classic Loot Manager v3.2.0
## Features
### Disenchant tracking

### Trade List
Currently pending trades are now viewable in new Trade List UI.
## Fixes
### ElvUI
ElvUI MS/OS buttons should no longer be stacked.
# Classic Loot Manager v3.1.4
## Changes

You can now export data through `/clm export` using `Standings` option and import it through `/clm importgeneric` when moving servers or changing guilds. This will retain rosters together with generic and auction configs. Iitem, slot and dynamic values are not retained. History is also lost. Profiles are recreated with new GUIDs (without links) and standings are retained.

# Classic Loot Manager v3.1.2

# Classic Loot Manager v3.1.1
## Hotfix
### Bidding UI
Bidding UI shouldn't error out on laggy servers anymore.
# Classic Loot Manager v3.1.0
## Notes
### Apache License 2.0
Classic Loot Manager has been relicensed from MIT to Apache2.
That means CLM is still fully FOSS but now when reusing the code you not only need to attribute ownership to the CLM creators but you also have to explicitly state which parts are reused and modified.
### v3.0.0
Be sure to read v3.0.0 release note if you haven't yet!
## Changes
### Moving items to the pending queue
Auctioner UI behavior was modified slightly. When right clicking on items they are moved to the pending queue (the additonal queue that is hidden and populated automatically when current auction is in progress) instead of being removed. This means that after current auction is completed and cleared those will still show up. This allows players to easily utilize tracking if not auctioning all the items at the same time. You can still completely remove item from the queue through `Ctrl + Right click`.
## Fixes
### Missing items
Multi Item Auction should no longer have missing items or errors. You will notice that sometimes items might load with a slight delay which is expected on laggy realms.
### Boss Kill Bonus

# Classic Loot Manager v3.0.4

Hotfix to not loading v3.0.1
# Classic Loot Manager v3.0.1
## Notes
### v3.0.0
Be sure to read v3.0.0 release note if you haven't yet!
## Fixes
### Out of Guild bidding
Players not in guild can now again participate in auctions. Both ML and player require at least this version of CLM.
### Lingering invisible bars
There should be no more invisible bars lingering during auctioning.
### Auto-Trade
Auto trade should work now as expected.
### Unusable detection
Detection of unusable items should be working agian.
### Award slash command
Award slash command has returned in old form as `/clm aw`.
### ElvUI
Open Auction list should be visible now.
# Classic Loot Manager v3.0.0
## Notes
With CLM v3 There comes a big mentality shift in the auctioning system towards becoming a more robust, point-based loot management framework. Notion of "English" or "Swedish" auction has been dropped towards bigger flexibility. This is a major change and as a consequence CLM v2 communication is not compatible with CLM v3 (but the database is preserved unlike when migrating from v1 to v2). Be aware that CLM does not allow multiple MAJOR versions to be used in one guild thus all v2 users will have their CLM disabled once someone starts to use v3.
This wouldn't be possible without all the contributors, translators and patrons, especially: `Allcoast, BigSpoon, naimious, Nosirrahdrof`.
## Multi Item Auction
### Notes
Classic Loot Manager now allows you to auction virtually any amount of items simultaneously. There are however some quirks that need to be looked into by officers for this to work as expected.
### Configuration
This rework brings some changes to auctioning configuration. **Be sure to review them to ensure your auction is working as expected.** Most significant changes are related to minimum, all-in and equal bids in Open Auction Mode.
### Invalid Bids
Bids are validated during auction. However the correctness might not apply anymore after items were awarded.
To solve this, after every item award, CLM re-calculates if the bids would be accepted and marks invalid bid with red color. This way the bids are not lost and it's up to Loot Master to decide how to handle it.
### Rolling
CLM includes internal rolling system (random) that appends a new random value to players bid whenever a bid comes in for the first time. This value is guarnateed to be unique and is meant for the ML to help with solving ties. However it does not come from `/random` server-side call thus is not visible in the chat.
### Handling items in the auction
Items can be added to the auction same as previously through alt-click (configurable). In addition to that, the previous Loot Queue has been merged with Auctioning into auto-fill auction feature. CLM can automatically add looted (received) items and items seen on corpse to the current auction. This can be configured per Master Looter prefference. Important! If items are added to auction during existing auction (manually or automatically) then CLM will remember it in a pending auction and display them when current auction is cleared of all items.
Auctioneer can manually remove items from auction by right clicking item icon on the list.
### Bidding GUI
Bidding GUI was reworked and now is more flexible. You can move the bar separately (and even test it through `/clm testbar` or through configuration button) and modify it's width. You should now more verbosely see if your bid was accepted, denied, or you passed or cancelled.
### Chat bidding
Chat bidding is currently disabled.
## Refinements
### Hard Mode support
Ulduar hard mode is now supported through configuration. If Boss Kill Bonus is enabled with normal and hardmode bonuses set to different (non-zero) values, after the kill a popup will show to decide if it was a normal or hard mode kill.
### History
Loot history now shows simple history when hovering over items but more extensive if hovering while holding `CTRL` modifier.
### Migration
Migration should now be slightly more resilient when executed multiple times by accident.
### Renames
Several options were renamed
### Multi AddOn
Classic Loot Manager is now split into multiple smaller addons. This is a first step towards even greater modularity. If you are using external `Integration` you will need to enable that module first! Export is currently only accessible through `/clm export` slash command.
## Feedback
### Please post your feedback
Be sure to post feedback about the changes, suggestions and bug reports on our discord (link can be found in the configuration, README and github).
## Fixes
### All-in
All-in should no longer be denied unexpectedly.
### History error
History should no longer get stuck on `Loading...` or generate lua-error when handling old historical data.
### Alerts
Alerts should now display proper currency.
### B.E.T.A.
Fixed all bugs found during B.E.T.A. testing. Thank you all for participating!
## Known issues
### Multi Item Auction
Award value Multiplier is not stored nor configurable.
### Scaling
Bidding GUI cannot be scaled at this time.
### GUI
Bidding GUI still needs some refinements and might change anytime.
### ElvUI skins
ElvUI bidding UI reskin might not be ideal. Best way to ensure the bidding UI looks properly you should not open the UI manually before first auction, otherwise `/reload` will be required for the UI to get fixed. Another option is to disable Ace3 reskin.
# Classic Loot Manager v2.7.0
## Notes
Thank you to all the patrons, especially: `Allcoast, BigSpoon, Cyber, naimious, Nosirrahdrof`
## Features
### Award GUI
No more tedious typing in slash commands! You can now award items through this new UI.
You can access it through minimap icon or `/clm award`. Award slash command accepts also item link as a parameter to directly fill `/clm award [item link]`. By default also `ALT+SHIFT click` in bags or corpse will open this window. Supports auto-trade and auto-assign.
### Configurable equations
You can now configure base / exponent of your dynamic item value equations. This was possible thanks to `psiven`. Use of this feature requires everyone in raid to have installed at least this version.
## Fixes
### Alt-Main linking
Re-linking alt will no longer prevent the alts previous main to be marked as alt itself. Improved messages in the linking flow.
# Classic Loot Manager v2.6.0
## Notes
### Library overhaul
CLM went through huge dependency and library overhaul and many of tooltip-related hacks were removed from CLM.
This also means that integrations with some tooltip-modifying AddOns might require fixes from their respective authors to show up in CLM since they are not based in the CLM itself anymore.
## Features
### CEPGP and BastionLoot Migration
/clm migrate now supports CEPGP and BastionLoot!
### Standby value multiplier
You can now configure multiplier for points received by players on standby (bench).
### PR Rounding
You can now configure PR rounding independently from the rest of the AddOn.
### OS Bid
You can now disable OS bidding support in the roster.
## Fixes
### EPGP Alt-Main Linking
GP value during linking is now calculated properly. This is a backwards-affecting change thus if you are already using this feature, you might be required to update the GP manually.
### Filtering
Death Knights should be now allowed to be filtered out properly.
### Item values in Dynamic mode
Bows and Crossbows should now properly be calculated as ranged weapons in Dynamic item value mode.
# Classic Loot Manager v2.5.6
## Fixes
### Standby
Fix for standby points not being applied if one of the players requesting standby was not in the roster.
Auto-add players to roster if they have requested standby.
### History
If point change affects only 1 player display the name instead of `Multiple`.
If player is missing class (which should not happen when adding characters post pre-patch), do not error out but display empty field.
### Memory usage
CLM v1 database is no longer stored in the AddOn thus lowering effective memory usage for big databases. There is no longer option to migrate from v1.x.x to v2.x.x after installing this version of CLM.
# Classic Loot Manager v2.5.5
## Locale
### Chinese
CLM now supports Chinese locale. Thanks brian#0179 for all the translations.
## Fixes

### Thank you supporters!
Thank you to all  that support us, either by contributing or donating through patreon: https://www.patreon.com/classiclootmanager.
Special thank you to legendary patrons: **naimious**
## New: Simplified User Interface
### No more bulky windows!
Main CLM windows: Standings, Point History, Loot History, Raids and Profiles are now combined in single window with tabs for ease of use. Additionaly Loot and Point History are now combined into common list.
### No more accidental selection clear!
Selection now works as expected:
- Single click to select a single row,
- Alt-click to select any row,
- Shift-click to select a range of rows.
### Filtering and search!
You can now search through data with ease.
### Visibility and QoL changes!
- You are now highlighted in standings,
- Minimap Icon can now be toggled on and off,
- Sounds can now be toggled on and off,
### Configurable keybinds!

## New: Auction and Bidding UI overhaul
### Auction window now highlights players roles
- blue for Tank
- green for Healer
- red for DPS
### Bidding window received general overhaul and is more compact than ever.
- Supports MS/OS bidding which is displayed in the Auction window. Original - MS bids are green, new OS bids are yellow.
- It can now be toggled by clicking on the timer bar\n- Tooltips will now properly display also when hovering over the item Icon
## New: Action Context mechanism
Previously CLM automatically selected every player in the UI. This is no more happening. With the new selection system there has been introduced a new concept: context. Your point awards will be based on this - either Roster, Raid or selection. By default context is Roster, when you select someone it's changed to selection, and if you're in raid it will default to Raid. Be sure to be aware of the context when working on the points.
## New: EPGP support
### Effort Points / Gear Points support is here!
You can now run simultaneously multiple DKP and EPGP raids and rosters at the same time, using all the great mechanisms CLM provides.
## New: Tiered bidding mode
Dedicated to EPGP but works great for DKP also - this system is a type of ascending bid system, where you can set up to 5 tiers of values which people will pay for an item, for example: 0, 30, 50, 70, 100 - no other values will be accepted by aucioneer. This comes with full UI support.
## New: Named buttons bidding mode
Dedicated to Tiered bidding mode - this allows you to name tiered bid buttons and use them instead of values (although the underlying values are still there). Both players bidding and auctioneer will see the text instead of value, while awarding will still result in the proper point deduction (DKP) or award (GP).
## New: Profile locking
You can now lock (and unlock) profiles. Now any point, either DKP, EP or GP, operations on those profiles, in any roster, will be ignored as long as profiles are locked. Locked players are displayed with red tint.
## Gargul by @Zh0rax integration
Gargul and CLM are coming with new integration for TMB/LC + DKP/EPGP use for more loot systems flexibilty!

### Exports
You can now export `Standings`, `Point History` and ` Loot History` to XML and JSON formats for integration with external tools. Check it through `/clm export` (or minimap icon if you're a Manager). Be aware that XML export for full database can be very heavy and timeout. This happens due to point history size. If this happens for you (e.g. game freezes and no output is produced) try reloading and limiting the export size. New optimizations coming soon!
## Fixes

Fixed missing value rounding for zero-sum bank without caps.
# Classic Loot Manager v1.6.0

## Features
### Time Travel
Have you ever awarded some DKP only a few days later, to realise it was in error? The thought of fixing it is such a hassle since you did a bunch of other stuff since then (eg, decay) and instead of the audit table looking clean now, it's full of manual corrections? Then this feature is for you! With `Time Travel` mode, you can now jump back to a point in time in your audit log and add/remove entries to make corrections / additions in certain point in time! Simply activate time travel through audit GUI and make your changes. They are applied instantly. AddOn management is almost fully available during time traveling. Raid management is disabled during time travel.
### Sandbox
`Sandbox` mode allows you to place the addon in a state where you are disconnected from others. While disconnected, you are free to do whatever you want without the worry of a change affecting your DKP setup. What might this be useful for? Say you bring a new officer into your team and you'd like to assign them the task of managing DKP. With this mode, they can train themselves doing all the normal DKP operations in isolation. If you make a set of changes, you can either choose to apply them or discard them once you are done.
# Classic Loot Manager v0.13.1
## Fixes
### ElvUI compatibility
Fix for ElvUI users which, after patch 2.19, handles UI differently, thus resulting in very weird button placements.
# Classic Loot Manager v0.13.0
## Features
### Loot Queue
You can now track items that you have looted into the inventory and auction them from a convenient list. Toggle it through `/clm queue`. Tracked loot quality can be changed in configuration.
## Fixes
### Alt-Main linking points fix

### Untrusted window display
Profiles, Raid and Audit window are now read-only accessible to all users through `/clm commands`
### Window location storing
Window location is now properly stored and restored when window is moved to the right side of the screen.

# Classic Loot Manager v0.12.0

# Classic Loot Manager v0.10.0

### Zero-Sum DKP
CLM now support Zero-Sum DKP. If you aren't aware of how Zero-Sum works, it's a DKP system where, at a rosters inception, an amount of DKP is awarded to each player and from that point onwards, no new DKP is awarded (although addon does not restrict it). When a player spends DKP (loot is awarded), that DKP is awarded evenly to the rest of the roster.
### Chat commands
You can now use the `!bid X` function to bid (even if you don't have CLM installed). It's not recommended though if you have CLM. Values supported include: value / pass / cancel. You can also get information about your standings through `!dkp`. This function needs to be enabled per trusted person.
### Player search
For convenience, you can now search for players by name on the standings screen. This is particularly helpful to those guilds with large rosters.
### Minimum bid increment
You can now configure minimum bid increment to be used in open auction mode.
## Quality of Life
### Smart DKP award
When applying DKP, CLM is now more context aware depending on filter settings. If you are in a raid, DKP will be assigned to raid members. If you aren't, it'll consider the roster, otherwise it will fall back onto the individual player selection. Alternately, selecting a player (or players) in a raid will override this new behaviour.
### Relaxed auctioning
Auctioning is no longer restricted to the master looter. The raid leader can now perform similar functions. Should also allow for bidding from outside of guild raiders.

# Classic Loot Manager v0.9.0

### Link your alt to your main character
You can now link an alt character in a roster to your main for the purposes of sharing DKP. For linking to work, characters must exist in the same roster. When you link and alt to a main, the DKP each character currently has is added together. From that point onwards, when one linked character has their DKP changed, the others will also. Loot and point histories are tracked against the alt-linked character they are applied against so in future, if you disconnect a main from an alt, history and point calculations will be retained seperately (and recalculated). To get started, type: `/clm link alt main`. You can unlink through `/clm unlink alt`. Removing alt-linked main from a roster will also remove the alt - make sure you unlink before you remove a main! Only trusted players can do that.
### CommunityDKP Migration Support
You can now migrate existing data to CLM. This includes: loot history, point history, and the current DKP standings. Configuration is not migrated. Undertaking a migration should be attempted by a GM with existing data backed up incase of a problem. Best practice is to do it as GM being the only one with CLM installed in the guild. You can trigger one through the command `/clm migrate`. Check out more information on wiki.
### Spec Sharing
Your spec will now be stored and shared numerically in the profile window for others to see.
### Bidding
Base and max buttons are now disabled if the respective limit is set to 0. Your current DKP is now displayed on the bidding window for convenience
### Standings
